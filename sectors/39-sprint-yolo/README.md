## 🚀 Overview

**The 8-Hour Sprint YOLO System. Run sprints that actually ship.**

Purpose:
- Compress weeks of work into 8 hours
- Eliminate distractions completely
- Ship something real
- Build momentum through wins

---

## ⏰ The YOLO Sprint Structure

### Hour 0: PREP (Before the Clock Starts)

```
□ Clear calendar (no meetings, notifications off)
□ Gather all resources (docs, access, tools)
□ Set up workspace (coffee, water, snacks ready)
□ Define ONE clear outcome
□ Tell everyone you're unavailable
□ Phone on airplane mode
□ Open only necessary tabs/apps
```

**Prep Checklist:**
- [ ] Calendar blocked (8 hours + buffer)
- [ ] Slack/Teams status: "DO NOT DISTURB - SPRINT"
- [ ] Email auto-reply on
- [ ] Phone in another room
- [ ] Coffee/tea prepared
- [ ] Water bottle filled
- [ ] Snacks ready (no cooking during sprint)
- [ ] All tabs/apps open
- [ ] Music playlist ready (no vocals)
- [ ] Timer visible

---

### Hour 1: FOUNDATION

**Minutes 0-15: Define the Target**

```
Write this down:
"In 8 hours, I will have shipped: ________________"

Be specific:
❌ "Work on the project"
✅ "Deploy v1.0 to production with 3 core features"
```

**Minutes 15-45: Gather Intelligence**

```
□ Review existing code/docs
□ Identify dependencies
□ List all known blockers
□ Find similar implementations
□ Bookmark key resources
```

**Minutes 45-60: Build the Skeleton**

```
□ Create file structure
□ Set up build system
□ Get "hello world" working
□ Verify toolchain
```

**Hour 1 Deliverable:** Working skeleton, clear target

---

### Hour 2-3: CORE BUILD

**The Rule:** One feature. Complete it. No switching.

```
□ Start with the ONE thing that matters
□ Build it end-to-end
□ Test it works
□ Commit when done
□ Move to next (if time)
```

**Anti-Distraction Rules:**
- No email
- No Slack
- No "quick research"
- No refactoring (yet)
- No perfecting (ship first)

**Hour 2-3 Deliverable:** First core feature complete

---

### Hour 4-5: EXPAND & INTEGRATE

**Now you can add more:**

```
□ Feature 2 (if time allows)
□ Integration points
□ Basic error handling
□ Logging/monitoring
```

**The 80% Rule:**
- Don't polish to 100%
- Ship at 80%
- Iterate later

**Hour 4-5 Deliverable:** Core functionality complete

---

### Hour 6: TEST & POLISH

**Switch to QA mode:**

```
□ Run through user journey
□ Fix critical bugs
□ Add missing error messages
□ Update README
□ Add basic tests (if not done)
```

**Bug Triage:**
| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Critical** (broken) | Fix now |
| **Major** (wrong) | Fix if <30 min |
| **Minor** (ugly) | Document, ship anyway |
| **Cosmetic** (nice-to-have) | Backlog |

**Hour 6 Deliverable:** Tested, documented, shippable

---

### Hour 7: DEPLOY

**Ship it:**

```
□ Final build
□ Deploy to production/staging
□ Verify deployment
□ Smoke test live
□ Monitor for errors
```

**Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Deployed
- [ ] Live URL works
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Team notified

**Hour 7 Deliverable:** LIVE IN PRODUCTION

---

### Hour 8: REVIEW & RETRO

**Celebrate first:**
```
□ Acknowledge what you shipped
□ Take a screenshot
□ Share with team/stakeholders
□ Feel the win
```

**Then learn:**
```
□ What went well?
□ What blocked you?
□ What would you do differently?
□ What's next?
```

**Document for next sprint:**
```
Sprint #___ - [DATE]
Shipped: ________________
Time: 8 hours
Wins: ________________
Blockers: ________________
Next: ________________
```

**Hour 8 Deliverable:** Retrospective documented, next sprint planned

## 🎯 Sprint Success Patterns

### What Works

| Pattern | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Single target** | Focus beats multitasking |
| **Time boxing** | Parkinson's Law (work expands) |
| **No distractions** | Context switching kills flow |
| **Regular breaks** | Sustained performance |
| **Ship at 80%** | Done beats perfect |
| **Celebrate wins** | Momentum builds |

### What Fails

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Multiple targets** | Diluted focus |
| **No time limit** | Procrastination |
| **Constant interruptions** | No flow state |
| **No breaks** | Burnout by hour 4 |
| **Perfecting** | Never ships |
| **No celebration** | No momentum |

## 📊 Sprint Scorecard

### Rate Your Sprint (1-10)

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Focus** (no distractions) | | |
| **Velocity** (speed of execution) | | |
| **Quality** (tested, documented) | | |
| **Completion** (hit target) | | |
| **Energy** (sustained through hour 8) | | |
| **Ship** (actually deployed) | | |
| **TOTAL** | /60 | |

**Interpretation:**

## 🎓 Sprint Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sprint Simulation

Before your first real sprint:
1. Pick a small task (1 hour)
2. Run it with full YOLO rules
3. Note what worked/didn't
4. Adjust for 8-hour version

### Exercise 2: Distraction Audit

Track your distractions for one day:
- How many Slack messages?
- How many emails?
- How many "quick questions"?
- How much context switching?

Use this to justify sprint boundaries.

### Exercise 3: Post-Sprint Retro

After each sprint:
1. What went well? (list 3)
2. What blocked you? (list 3)
3. What will you change next time? (list 3)
4. Schedule next sprint
