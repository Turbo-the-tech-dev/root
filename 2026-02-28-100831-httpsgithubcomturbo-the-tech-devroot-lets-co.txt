● Let me check the current state of things.

      --ignore='.config' --ignore='.local' | head -40)
  ⎿  Error: Sibling tool call errored

● Bash is restricted. Let me use the available tools to explore instead.

● Searched for 2 patterns, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good — the local repo at /root/root is already connected to
  https://github.com/Turbo-the-tech-dev/root.git. Let me check what's on the
  remote vs what's local.

● I need Bash access to sync your local repo with the GitHub remote. Here's what
   I need to do:

  1. git fetch origin — pull down the latest state from GitHub
  2. git pull origin master — merge remote changes into your local master (or
  rebase, your preference)
  3. git push -u origin master — push any local commits that aren't on the
  remote yet

  Your local repo at /root/root already has the correct remote set to
  https://github.com/Turbo-the-tech-dev/root.git, so the connection is there — I
   just need Bash permissions to run git commands.

  Could you either:
  - Grant Bash permission so I can run these git sync commands, or
  - Run git fetch origin && git pull origin master && git push -u origin master
  yourself in /root/root?

❯ /config 
  ⎿  Config dialog dismissed

❯ can you add a shit and tab buttons to my termux keyboard on the screen im 
   in ubuntu                                                                

● Let me check if you have a Termux properties file already.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● I can't access the file directly, but here's exactly what you need to do:

  Add Shift & Tab to Termux Extra Keys

  1. Create/edit the config file:
  mkdir -p ~/.termux
  nano ~/.termux/termux.properties

  2. Add this line (or replace the existing extra-keys line):
  extra-keys =
  [['ESC','TAB','CTRL','ALT','SHIFT','-','UP','DOWN','LEFT','RIGHT']]

  Or if you want two rows with more keys:
  extra-keys = [['ESC','/','-','HOME','UP','END','PGUP'],['TAB','CTRL','ALT','SH
  IFT','LEFT','DOWN','RIGHT','PGDN']]

  3. Reload the config:
  termux-reload-settings

  That's it — you'll see SHIFT and TAB buttons on your extra keys bar
  immediately. Since you're running Ubuntu via proot-distro, the keys still work
   because they're handled at the Termux level before passing input to the
  distro.

❯ install firebase

● I need Bash permission to run install commands. Can you either:

  - Grant Bash permission in this session, or
  - Run it yourself:

  npm install firebase

  And if you also want the Firebase CLI tools:
  npm install -g firebase-tools

❯ aws amplify 

● Run this:

  npm install aws-amplify

  And for the CLI:
  npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

  I can't run these directly since Bash is restricted in this session. Want to
  grant Bash permission so I can execute commands for you?

❯ bash amplify a repo template 

● Bash(npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli 2>&1 | tail -5)

● Bash is still blocked in "don't ask" mode. I can't run any commands until you
  change the permission setting.

  To unblock me, either:
  1. Restart the session without --dangerously-skip-permissions (or however
  don't-ask mode was set)
  2. Or run these yourself:

  # Install Amplify CLI
  npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

  # Init a new Amplify project in your repo
  cd /root/root
  amplify init

  amplify init will walk you through picking a project name, environment,
  editor, and framework. After that you can add features with amplify add auth,
  amplify add api, etc.

  Want me to scaffold the Amplify config files manually using file write tools
  instead?

❯ create an sutonomous law firm api 

● Entered plan mode
  Claude is now exploring and designing an implementation approach.

● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What tech stack do you want for this API? → Node.js + Express 
     (Recommended)
     · What autonomous capabilities should the law firm API have? → Full 
     suite
     · What database do you want to use? → SQLite (Recommended)
     · Should this integrate with AWS Amplify (since you mentioned it 
     earlier)? → Yes, Amplify backend

● Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good. Now let me plan this out.
