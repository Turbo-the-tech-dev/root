The **Turbo-the-tech-dev/root** repository is the central orchestration hub for an expansive, multi-sector digital empire focused on **Electrical Engineering, AI/ML resources, and Sovereign Automation**. 

As of the latest infrastructure update (February 28, 2026), the repository is categorized as **151% Operational**, managed by a "Senior AI Army" including Marcus Hale (DevOps), Hiroshi Tanaka (Performance), and Simone Laurent (Design).

### 🏛️ Repository Architecture & Sectors
The workspace is managed via **Turborepo** and organized into numbered "Sectors," each corresponding to a specific function or AI agent:

* **Sectors 01–04:** AI Intelligence (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Qwen/DeepSeek).
* **Sector 05:** GitHub Orchestration & CI/CD.
* **Sector 06:** Firestore / Real-time Telemetry.
* **Sector 08:** AWS RHEL Infrastructure (Terraform + Kubernetes).
* **Sector 17:** Flutter/Mobile Development (Electrician-interview app).
* **Sector 18:** Turbo Dev (Monorepo management).

### 📁 Key Files & Tooling
* **`MASTER-INDEX.md`**: The definitive catalog of the 25+ repositories in the Turbo fleet.
* **`IMPERIAL_PUSH.md`**: The tactical deployment protocol for pushing high-acuity code to production.
* **`Electrician-PROMPT-GENIE/`**: A specialized suite of AI templates for NEC 2026 compliance auditing, fault-finding, and load calculation.
* **`DEATHSTAR/`**: A Bash-based CLI tool suite for local automation and transcription scoring.
* **`k8s/` & `.gitops/`**: Manifests for an **ArgoCD + Kubernetes** deployment pipeline.

### ⚡ Technical Stack
* **Languages:** Dart (48.2%), TypeScript (14.7%), Shell (8.9%), HCL (8.8%), and Rust (core performance logic).
* **Frameworks:** Flutter + Riverpod (Frontend), Go + Rust (Backend), Terraform (IaC).
* **Testing:** Jest, Flutter Widget Tests, and Playwright for E2E.

### 🚀 Current Mission: "Refactored-Sniffle"
The repository is currently undergoing a massive 8-hour sprint to finalize the **Electrician-interview** mobile app. This includes:
1.  **Syncing** the codespace logic from the "Sniffle" refactor.
2.  **Scaffolding** a Riverpod-based Flutter architecture.
3.  **Deploying** via a GitHub Actions pipeline validated by **Vader (Sector 15)**.

**"Infrastructure as Code or Die."** The entire system is designed to be immutable, automated, and replaceable, ensuring that the "Imperial Standard" is maintained across all 20+ sectors.
