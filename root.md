  ✦ Great setup! You've got a solid foundation with Riverpod state management, go_router
    navigation, and clean feature-based architecture.

    Here are your next sprint options ranked by impact:

    1. Rich Text Input Screen — Enables core functionality (creating projects with rich content
     + voice)
    2. Project Detail View — Completes the CRUD flow, lets users actually view/edit existing
    projects
    3. AWS Amplify Auth — Infrastructure work, unlocks protected routes and real backend
    4. Dark Mode Toggle — Polish/UX enhancement

    ---

    My recommendation: Start with #2 (Project Detail View) — it's the natural next piece to
    complete the user journey. Then tackle #1 (Rich Input) so users can create projects with
    rich content. This gives you a working end-to-end flow before adding AWS complexity.

    Which direction do you want to go? Or should I spin up a specialized agent to tackle one of
     these?
